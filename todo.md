## High Priority - Bugs & Core Features
- [x] **Design and implement `temporal_merge` deletion semantics:** Based on the architecture outlined in `docs/temporal_merge_delete_semantics.md`, added a new `p_delete_mode` parameter to `temporal_merge` to allow for opt-in destructive deletes. This enables "source as truth" synchronization for ETL processes while maintaining safe, non-destructive behavior by default.
- [x] **Improve `temporal_merge` parameter validation:** Added server-side checks to `temporal_merge` to provide clear, immediate error messages for invalid parameters, such as `NULL` or non-existent column names, improving developer experience.
- [x] **Implement `sql_saga.temporal_merge` (Set-Based Upsert API):** Provided a single, high-performance, set-based function for `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` operations on temporal tables. The API is simplified via `regclass` parameters, era introspection, and auto-detection of defaulted columns. This is the official solution for bulk data modifications.

- [x] **Fix duplicated column in FK trigger `UPDATE OF` list:** Corrected `add_foreign_key` to prevent adding a synchronized `valid_to`-style column to the trigger's `UPDATE OF` list if it is already part of the era's temporal columns, resolving a "column specified more than once" error. The fix is generic and respects the `synchronize_valid_to_column` era metadata.

- [x] **Improve `rename_following` to support column renames:** The event trigger now correctly detects when a column in a foreign key is renamed and automatically updates all relevant metadata, including the foreign key name, column list, and associated trigger names.

- [x] **Foreign key validation fails for tables in different schemas:** Fixed. The `fk_update_trigger` is now created with a dynamic column list that includes `valid_to` (if present) to ensure validation fires correctly for synchronized columns without being an overly-broad row-level trigger.

- [x] **Support identifiers with quotes inside:** Verified API functions handle quoted identifiers correctly.
- [x] **Cache query plans:** Cached query plans to improve trigger performance.
- [x] **Refactor core to use `(schema, table)` instead of `oid`:** Made event triggers robust against `DROP`.
- [x] **(Breaking Change) Adopted `[valid_from, valid_until)` period semantics:** Refactored the extension to use the standard `[)` inclusive-exclusive period convention, renaming all temporal columns accordingly.

- [x] **Implement System Versioning:** Ported the complete System Versioning feature from `periods`, including history tables, C-based triggers (`generated_always_as_row_start_end`, `write_history`), and the `add/drop_system_versioning` API.
- [x] **Feat(api): Add unified synchronization for temporal columns:** Enhanced `add_era` to support `p_synchronize_valid_to_column` and `p_synchronize_range_column`. This creates a single, unified trigger to keep all temporal representations (bounds, `valid_to`, range) consistent and enables declarative metadata for synchronization.

## Medium Priority - Refactoring & API Improvements

- [x] **Refactor default value handling to be metadata-driven**: Implemented a robust, metadata-driven strategy for default values. For simple eras, `add_era` sets `DEFAULT 'infinity'`. For eras with synchronized columns, a metadata flag instructs the trigger to programmatically apply the default on `INSERT`. This removes the brittle `'infinity'` heuristic and adds fail-fast consistency checks for `UPDATE` operations.

- [x] **Simplify `for_portion_of` view semantics**: Refactored the `for_portion_of` view to only provide the complex "apply change to a time slice" `UPDATE` functionality. Simple `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations are now disallowed on the view and must be performed on the base table.

- [x] **Fix regressions from optional `add_era` parameters**: Resolved failures in `04_synchronize_validity_trigger` and other tests caused by `add_era`'s new default-setting behavior interacting incorrectly with generated columns and the synchronization trigger's consistency checks.

- [x] **Make `add_era` constraints and defaults optional**: Added `p_add_defaults` and `p_add_bounds_check` parameters to `add_era` to allow users to opt out of the default integrity management. This provides flexibility for advanced use cases while maintaining a safe default.

- [x] **Set `valid_until` to `DEFAULT 'infinity'` in `add_era`**: Modified `add_era` to be type-aware, automatically setting `DEFAULT 'infinity'` and stricter `CHECK` constraints on `valid_until` columns only for data types that support infinity. This improves ergonomics while maintaining correctness for all types.

- [x] **Document Updatable Views in README:** Updated `README.md` with a comprehensive section on the `for_portion_of` and `current` updatable views, explaining their purpose, DML protocols, and security model. The runnable example test (`47_readme_usage.sql`) has been extended to cover the usage of these views.

- [x] **Support Predicates for Temporally Unique Keys:** Extended `add_unique_key` to support a `WHERE` clause for creating partial unique keys (e.g., `WHERE legal_unit_id IS NOT NULL`). This uses a unique index with a predicate instead of a unique constraint.

- [x] **Refactor `temporal_merge` to a procedure for better ergonomics:** Converted the `temporal_merge` function into a procedure. Instead of returning a set of results, it now creates a temporary table `__temp_last_sql_saga_temporal_merge` with the feedback, simplifying the calling pattern.
- [x] **Rename `add_api` to `add_updatable_views` for clarity:** Renamed `add_api` and `drop_api` to `add_updatable_views` and `drop_updatable_views` respectively, to better reflect their purpose of managing views for temporal data.

- [x] **Refactor and Finalize `for_portion_of` Updatable View:** Ported and expanded test coverage from legacy files, and formalized DML semantics. The view's behavior, including its known limitation of not coalescing adjacent identical rows from multi-row updates, is now fully verified by the test suite.

- [x] **Implement `current` Updatable View:** Created the new `current` view with a robust and explicit DML protocol for easy integration with ORMs and APIs.
    - **Phase 1: Data Model (Shared Prerequisite - Complete):**
        - [x] `updatable_view` metadata table and `updatable_view_type` enum are in place.
    - **Phase 2: Define the Goal (Tests & Docs) - Complete:**
        - [x] `README.md` is updated with the symmetrical `add/drop_current_view` API reference.
        - [x] Created the primary test file (`sql/30_updatable_view_current_basis.sql`) to define the target behavior.
    - **Phase 3: Implementation - Complete:**
        - [x] Created the `add_current_view` and `drop_current_view` functions.
        - [x] Implemented the trigger logic with an explicit `UPDATE` protocol for SCD Type 2 and soft-deletes, while disallowing ambiguous `DELETE`s.
    - **Phase 4: Verification (Basis) - Complete:**
        - [x] The `30_updatable_view_current_basis.sql` test is now passing.

- [x] **Synchronized: Full Test Coverage & Cleanup:**
    - **Prerequisite:** Phase 4 must be complete for *both* `for_portion_of` and `current` views.
    - **Phase 5: Full Test Coverage:**
        - [x] `sql/31_updatable_view_for_portion_of_full.sql` is passing, covering edge cases and ACLs for `for_portion_of` views.
        - [x] `sql/32_updatable_view_current_full.sql` is passing, now with full coverage for both empty- and non-empty-range soft-deletes.
        - [x] The two `current` view tests (`30_..._basis` and `32_..._full`) cover both `delete_as_cutoff` and `delete_as_documented_ending` modes.
        - [x] `sql/34_updatable_views_types.sql` is passing, testing both views against all supported range types.
    - **Phase 6: Deprecation & Finalization:**
        - [x] Deprecate `07_for_portion_of.sql` and `21_api_lifecycle.sql` now that their functionality is fully covered by the new, structured test suite.

- [x] **Refactor `temporal_merge` founding ID logic:** Made the source `row_id` column configurable (`p_source_row_id_column`) and implemented the `p_founding_id_column` to handle intra-batch dependencies for new entities.

- [x] **Create a test suite for `temporal_merge` parameter edge cases:** The test `52_temporal_merge_parameters.sql` now provides comprehensive coverage for API parameter variations, including `NULL` and empty `p_id_columns`, non-existent column names, custom source row identifiers, and fully non-standard naming conventions.

- [x] **Add runnable test for README usage examples:** Created a self-contained test that executes the code from the `README.md` "Usage" section. This test serves as living documentation, verifying the public API and demonstrating a realistic `temporal_merge` data loading pattern with ID back-filling.

- [x] **Optimize `temporal_merge` with prepared statements:** Refactored the expensive planner query (`temporal_merge_plan`) to use hash-based prepared statement caching. This improves performance for repeated calls with the same parameters by avoiding redundant query planning and introspection, while keeping the main orchestrator procedure simple and readable.
- [x] **Add happy-path test coverage for all `temporal_merge` modes and supported range types:** Created two new test files (`49_temporal_merge_modes.sql` and `50_temporal_merge_types.sql`) to verify the behavior of all merge modes and data types, improving overall test coverage.

- [x] **Clarify `temporal_merge` feedback statuses:** Renamed the feedback status enums for clarity. The public status is now `temporal_merge_status` with values `APPLIED`, `SKIPPED`, `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, and `ERROR`. The internal planner enum is now `planner_action` with `IDENTICAL` replacing `NOOP`.

- [x] **Temporal Merge with Dependent Row Support:** Refactored `temporal_merge` to correctly handle batches containing dependent operations (e.g., an `INSERT` of a new entity and subsequent `UPDATE`s to it). This was achieved by changing the API to accept a `p_founding_id_column` and implementing internal, multi-stage ID propagation logic, making the function truly set-based and robust.

- [x] **Remove obsolete legacy files:** Deleted unused source files (`periods.c`, `time_for_keys.c`, etc.) from the repository to reduce clutter and prevent confusion.

- [x] **Make `temporal_merge` fully dynamic:** Analyzed `temporal_merge` for hardcoded column names. Verified through searches that all user-data columns are handled dynamically. The single identified "hardcoded" string is a private, internal implementation detail for state management, which is a correct design. No changes were needed.

- [x] **Add option to back-fill generated IDs into source table:** Extended `temporal_merge` with a new parameter `p_update_source_with_assigned_entity_ids`. When `true`, the procedure will update the source table with any generated surrogate or composite key values for newly inserted entities. This simplifies multi-step import processes by removing the need for manual ID propagation between steps.

- [x] **Ensure Symmetrical APIs:** Refactored `drop_unique_key` and `drop_foreign_key` to be unambiguous by renaming the `_by_name` variants. Aligned tests to use the more intuitive symmetrical API calls by default.
- [x] **Standardize System Versioning Column Naming:** Renamed system versioning columns to `system_valid_from` and `system_valid_until` to be consistent with application-time `valid_from`/`valid_until` semantics.

- [x] **Refactor test suite:** Made all tests self-contained and idempotent, resolving all regressions.

- [x] **Complete the `regclass` -> `(schema, table)` refactoring:** Removed all `oid` columns from metadata tables, making event triggers robust against `DROP`.

- [x] **Refactor `add_updatable_views` to not require a primary key:** Refactored `add_updatable_views` to use a single-column temporal unique key as the entity identifier if no primary key is present. Fixed `update_portion_of` trigger to correctly preserve identifier columns during updates.

- [x] **Fix event trigger regressions:** Resolved bugs in `rename_following` and `health_checks` event triggers that were exposed by refactoring. The triggers now correctly handle `search_path` issues and reliably update metadata for renamed objects.

- [x] **Refactor build system and fix all regressions:** Overhauled the `Makefile` to ensure reliable, incremental builds. Refactored the SQL source into a modular structure and resolved all test failures that were exposed by the new build process.

- [x] **Support foreign keys from non-temporal tables:** Provided full foreign key support from standard tables to temporal tables. The `add_foreign_key` function now automatically creates a `CHECK` constraint on the referencing table and `UPDATE`/`DELETE` triggers on the referenced temporal table to provide full `RESTRICT`/`NO ACTION` semantics.


## Low Priority - Future Work & New Features

- [x] **Use `pg_temp` schema for temporary tables**: Refactored `temporal_merge` to create its feedback table in the session-local `pg_temp` schema for improved robustness and concurrency safety.
- [x] **Enforce `NOT NULL` on synchronized temporal columns**: Modified `add_era` to apply `NOT NULL` constraints on `valid_to` and `valid_range` columns when synchronization is enabled to strengthen data integrity guarantees.
- [ ] **Package `sql_saga` with pgxman for distribution:**
  - **Issue:** The extension currently requires manual installation.
  - **Action:** Create configuration files and a process to package the extension using `pgxman` for easier distribution and installation.

## Learnings from Inspired Projects (`periods` and `time_for_keys`)

This section summarizes potential improvements and features adapted from the `periods` and `time_for_keys` extensions, which served as inspiration for `sql_saga`.

### From `periods` extension:

- [x] **Enhance Event Trigger Logic:** `periods` has robust `drop_protection` and `rename_following` event triggers.
  - **Action:** Compared logic in `periods` with `sql_saga`'s event triggers. `sql_saga`'s logic is a correct subset of `periods`, and includes a performance optimization for `rename_following` that `periods` lacks. No further changes needed.

### From `time_for_keys` extension:

- [x] **Analyze Alternative Foreign Key Implementation:** The `time_for_keys` project represents a less dynamic, but potentially faster, approach to temporal foreign keys. Instead of a central metadata catalog, it creates specific triggers for each foreign key constraint. The legacy code for this was removed from `sql_saga` to avoid confusion.
  - **Action:** Analysis complete. The `time_for_keys` approach uses `pl/pgsql` triggers that re-plan validation queries on every row, making it significantly less performant than `sql_saga`'s current C-based triggers with cached query plans. The recent refactoring in `sql_saga` to pass all metadata as arguments has already adopted the best part of this design while implementing it in a much more performant way. No changes are warranted.

- [x] **Evaluate Alternative Gap-Coverage Functions:** `periods` uses a `pl/pgsql` implementation for temporal validation, and `time_for_keys` has a `no_gaps` function specialized for `daterange`. `sql_saga`'s C-based `covers_without_gaps` aggregate for `anyrange` is a deliberate improvement.
  - **Action:** Analysis complete. The `covers_without_gaps` function in `sql_saga` is more performant than the `periods` implementation and more generic and correct than the `time_for_keys` version. It successfully passes a more comprehensive test suite ported from `time_for_keys`, fixing regressions that were present in the `periods` logic. No changes are needed.
