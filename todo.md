## High Priority - Bugs & Core Features

## Medium Priority - Refactoring & API Improvements

- [ ] **Implement High-Performance, Set-Based Upsert API (The "Plan and Execute" Pattern):**
  - **Goal:** Provide official, high-performance, set-based functions for performing `INSERT OR UPDATE` and `INSERT OR REPLACE` operations on temporal tables. This should be the primary API for complex data loading.
  - **Problem:** Multi-statement transactions that perform complex temporal changes cannot be reliably validated by `sql_saga`'s `CONSTRAINT TRIGGER`s due to PostgreSQL's MVCC snapshot rules.
  - **Validated Solution (The "Statbus Pattern"):** An external project (`statbus_speed`) has validated the definitive "Plan and Execute" solution. This pattern must be implemented inside a single procedural function (ideally in C for performance) that:
    1.  **Plans (Read-Only):** Reads all source and target data and calculates a complete DML plan (`DELETE`s, `UPDATE`s, `INSERT`s) that is guaranteed to result in a consistent final timeline.
    2.  **Executes (Write-Only):** Executes the pre-calculated plan using a specific **"add-then-modify" order**. It must perform `INSERT`s of new data before `UPDATE`ing or `DELETE`ing the old data that is being replaced. This ensures `sql_saga`'s triggers can validate the final state correctly.
  - **Benefit:** A call to this function is a single top-level statement. `sql_saga`'s deferred triggers fire only at the end, validating a state that the planner has already guaranteed is correct. This is the architecturally sound solution to the multi-statement update problem and provides a path to re-enabling the tests in `28_with_exclusion_constraints.sql` by having them use this new API.

- [ ] **Investigate Statement-Level Triggers:**
  - **Goal:** Replace the `uk_update_check_c` and `uk_delete_check_c` row-level triggers with statement-level triggers.
  - **Benefit:** This would provide correct validation for complex, single-statement DML operations that modify multiple rows (e.g., `UPDATE ... FROM ...`, `MERGE`). This is the architecturally correct way to handle multi-row validation.
  - **Limitation:** This would not solve the problem of multi-statement transactions that are only valid at commit time (e.g., two separate `UPDATE` statements swapping periods), as statement-level triggers are not deferrable to the end of the transaction. This limitation should be documented.

## Low Priority - Future Work & New Features

- [ ] **Support foreign keys from non-temporal tables:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The current implementation only supports foreign keys between two temporal tables.
  - **Action:** Adapt `sql_saga.add_foreign_key` to allow a non-temporal table to reference a temporal table. This would require a check function to validate the key's existence at the time of insert/update.

- [ ] **Prototype a combined UPSERT/UPDATE API:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The current API for updating data is complex.
  - **Action:** Prototype a new `sql_saga.add_api` function or a new function that provides a simpler interface for handling both `INSERT` and `UPDATE` (UPSERT) operations on temporal data.

- [ ] **Ensure `infinity` is the default for `valid_to` columns:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The `add_era` function does not enforce `'infinity'` as the default value for the `stop_on_column_name` (e.g., `valid_to`).
  - **Action:** Modify `add_era` to set the default and potentially add a check constraint.

- [ ] **Implement full `ON UPDATE` action support for foreign keys:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The `update_action` parameter in `add_foreign_key` is not fully handled; the comment notes it should affect trigger timing.
  - **Action:** Implement the logic for `ON UPDATE` actions (`NO ACTION`, `RESTRICT`) correctly.

- [ ] **Package `sql_saga` with pgxman for distribution:**
  - **Issue:** The extension currently requires manual installation.
  - **Action:** Create configuration files and a process to package the extension using `pgxman` for easier distribution and installation.

## Learnings from Inspired Projects (`periods` and `time_for_keys`)

This section summarizes potential improvements and features adapted from the `periods` and `time_for_keys` extensions, which served as inspiration for `sql_saga`.

### From `periods` extension:

- [ ] **Implement System Versioning:** `periods` contains a complete implementation of `SYSTEM VERSIONING`, including history tables, views, and helper functions (`_as_of`, `_between`, etc.). This is a major feature that `sql_saga` currently has commented-out stubs for.
  - **Action:** Review the `periods.system_versioning` table and the `add_system_versioning` function as a blueprint for implementing this feature in `sql_saga`.

- [ ] **Adopt C-based Trigger Functions for Performance:** `periods.c` contains C implementations for `generated_always_as_row_start_end` and `write_history` triggers. This is a significant performance enhancement over `pl/pgsql`.
  - **Action:** Use `periods.c` as a reference for moving performance-critical trigger logic in `sql_saga` to C. This includes handling different tuple descriptors between the main table and history table.

- [ ] **Enhance Event Trigger Logic:** `periods` has robust `drop_protection` and `rename_following` event triggers.
  - **Action:** Compare the logic in `periods` with `sql_saga`'s event triggers to identify any missing checks or opportunities for improvement.

### From `time_for_keys` extension:

- [ ] **Analyze Alternative Foreign Key Implementation:** The `time_for_keys` project represents a less dynamic, but potentially faster, approach to temporal foreign keys. Instead of a central metadata catalog, it creates specific triggers for each foreign key constraint. The legacy code for this was removed from `sql_saga` to avoid confusion.
  - **Action:** Analyze the performance of this approach (by reviewing the `time_for_keys` project) vs. `sql_saga`'s metadata-driven approach. The recent refactoring in `sql_saga` to pass metadata as arguments to triggers might have closed the performance gap.

- [ ] **Evaluate `completely_covers` Aggregate Function:** The C function in `completely_covers.c` is specialized for `tstzrange` and is used to validate temporal foreign keys. `sql_saga` has a generic `covers_without_gaps` aggregate for `anyrange`.
  - **Action:** Compare the performance and correctness of `completely_covers` against `covers_without_gaps`. A specialized function might be faster. Determine if `sql_saga` would benefit from specialized aggregates for common range types.
