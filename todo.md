# SQL Saga - TODO

A living document of upcoming tasks.
Tasks are checked âœ… when done and made brief.
Keep a journal.md that tracks the state of the current ongoing task and relevant details.

## High Priority - Bugs & Core Features

- [x] **Foreign key validation fails for tables in different schemas:** Fixed. The `fk_update_trigger` is now created with a dynamic column list that includes `valid_to` (if present) to ensure validation fires correctly for synchronized columns without being an overly-broad row-level trigger.

- [x] **Support identifiers with quotes inside:** Verified API functions handle quoted identifiers correctly.
- [x] **Cache query plans:** Cached query plans to improve trigger performance.
- [x] **Refactor core to use `(schema, table)` instead of `oid`:** Made event triggers robust against `DROP`.
- [x] **(Breaking Change) Adopted `[valid_from, valid_until)` period semantics:** Refactored the extension to use the standard `[)` inclusive-exclusive period convention, renaming all temporal columns accordingly.

- [x] **Implement System Versioning:** Ported the complete System Versioning feature from `periods`, including history tables, C-based triggers (`generated_always_as_row_start_end`, `write_history`), and the `add/drop_system_versioning` API.

## Medium Priority - Refactoring & API Improvements

- [x] **Ensure Symmetrical APIs:** Refactored `drop_unique_key` and `drop_foreign_key` to be unambiguous by renaming the `_by_name` variants. Aligned tests to use the more intuitive symmetrical API calls by default.
- [x] **Standardize System Versioning Column Naming:** Renamed system versioning columns to `system_valid_from` and `system_valid_until` to be consistent with application-time `valid_from`/`valid_until` semantics.

- [x] **Refactor test suite:** Made all tests self-contained and idempotent, resolving all regressions.

- [x] **Complete the `regclass` -> `(schema, table)` refactoring:** Removed all `oid` columns from metadata tables, making event triggers robust against `DROP`.

- [x] **Provide convenience trigger `synchronize_valid_to_until`:** Added trigger to help manage human-readable inclusive end-dates.

- [x] **Refactor `add_api` to not require a primary key:** Refactored `add_api` to use a single-column temporal unique key as the entity identifier if no primary key is present. Fixed `update_portion_of` trigger to correctly preserve identifier columns during updates.

- [ ] **Implement `sql_saga.temporal_merge` (Set-Based Upsert API):**
  - **Goal:** Provide a single, high-performance, set-based function for `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` operations on temporal tables, solving the MVCC visibility problem for complex data loads.
  - **Status:** **Design Phase**. A detailed design document (`todo-temporal-merge.md`) is being created based on the validated "Plan and Execute" pattern from the `statbus_speed` project. The API will be finalized before implementation begins.
  - **Benefit:** This function will become the official, architecturally sound solution for bulk data modifications, enabling the re-activation of previously disabled complex tests.

- [ ] **Investigate Statement-Level Triggers:**
  - **Goal:** Replace the `uk_update_check_c` and `uk_delete_check_c` row-level triggers with statement-level triggers.
  - **Benefit:** This would provide correct validation for complex, single-statement DML operations that modify multiple rows (e.g., `UPDATE ... FROM ...`, `MERGE`). This is the architecturally correct way to handle multi-row validation.
  - **Limitation:** This would not solve the problem of multi-statement transactions that are only valid at commit time (e.g., two separate `UPDATE` statements swapping periods), as statement-level triggers are not deferrable to the end of the transaction. This limitation should be documented.

## Low Priority - Future Work & New Features

- [ ] **Support foreign keys from non-temporal tables:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The current implementation only supports foreign keys between two temporal tables.
  - **Action:** Adapt `sql_saga.add_foreign_key` to allow a non-temporal table to reference a temporal table. This would require a check function to validate the key's existence at the time of insert/update.

- [ ] **Prototype a combined UPSERT/UPDATE API:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The current API for updating data is complex.
  - **Action:** Prototype a new `sql_saga.add_api` function or a new function that provides a simpler interface for handling both `INSERT` and `UPDATE` (UPSERT) operations on temporal data.

- [ ] **Ensure `infinity` is the default for `valid_to` columns:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The `add_era` function does not enforce `'infinity'` as the default value for the `stop_on_column_name` (e.g., `valid_to`).
  - **Action:** Modify `add_era` to set the default and potentially add a check constraint.

- [ ] **Implement full `ON UPDATE` action support for foreign keys:**
  - **File:** `sql_saga--1.0.sql`
  - **Issue:** The `update_action` parameter in `add_foreign_key` is not fully handled; the comment notes it should affect trigger timing.
  - **Action:** Implement the logic for `ON UPDATE` actions (`NO ACTION`, `RESTRICT`) correctly.

- [ ] **Package `sql_saga` with pgxman for distribution:**
  - **Issue:** The extension currently requires manual installation.
  - **Action:** Create configuration files and a process to package the extension using `pgxman` for easier distribution and installation.

## Learnings from Inspired Projects (`periods` and `time_for_keys`)

This section summarizes potential improvements and features adapted from the `periods` and `time_for_keys` extensions, which served as inspiration for `sql_saga`.

### From `periods` extension:

- [x] **Enhance Event Trigger Logic:** `periods` has robust `drop_protection` and `rename_following` event triggers.
  - **Action:** Compared logic in `periods` with `sql_saga`'s event triggers. `sql_saga`'s logic is a correct subset of `periods`, and includes a performance optimization for `rename_following` that `periods` lacks. No further changes needed.

### From `time_for_keys` extension:

- [x] **Analyze Alternative Foreign Key Implementation:** The `time_for_keys` project represents a less dynamic, but potentially faster, approach to temporal foreign keys. Instead of a central metadata catalog, it creates specific triggers for each foreign key constraint. The legacy code for this was removed from `sql_saga` to avoid confusion.
  - **Action:** Analysis complete. The `time_for_keys` approach uses `pl/pgsql` triggers that re-plan validation queries on every row, making it significantly less performant than `sql_saga`'s current C-based triggers with cached query plans. The recent refactoring in `sql_saga` to pass all metadata as arguments has already adopted the best part of this design while implementing it in a much more performant way. No changes are warranted.

- [x] **Evaluate Alternative Gap-Coverage Functions:** `periods` uses a `pl/pgsql` implementation for temporal validation, and `time_for_keys` has a `no_gaps` function specialized for `daterange`. `sql_saga`'s C-based `covers_without_gaps` aggregate for `anyrange` is a deliberate improvement.
  - **Action:** Analysis complete. The `covers_without_gaps` function in `sql_saga` is more performant than the `periods` implementation and more generic and correct than the `time_for_keys` version. It successfully passes a more comprehensive test suite ported from `time_for_keys`, fixing regressions that were present in the `periods` logic. No changes are needed.
